send-cache is plugin for returning cache content to nagios. It may be called
through NRPE and is, effectively, equivalent to passive plugins.  The main
drawback of passive plugins, is that it can update state of other (passive?)
plugin, just by specifying it in PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT.  But by using
"emulation" of passive checks with send-cache active plugin, i can avoid such
situation.

Cache file should be written by write-plugin-cache . I.e. i should call other
nagios plugin, which result i want to write in cache, by passing its path and
arguments to write-plugin-cache . Then write-plugin-cache will invoke plugin
and save its result to cache. By default cache file name is plugin name
followed by '.cache' suffix. Though, cache file path or just file name may be
specified using '--cache' option. If path to cache file does not specified
(either just name given to '--cache' or no '--cache' option at all), cache
file will be placed in /var/cache/nagios3 .

send-cache plugin also accepts '--cache' option, which should be used if cache
has been placed in non-standard location . Or if i've used default cache in
write-plugin-cache, i may just call send-cache with plugin name (the same way
as i did for write-plugin-cache) . Then send-cache will also assume default
cache file name for plugin.
